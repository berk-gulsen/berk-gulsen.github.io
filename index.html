        <p class="lead mb-4">I’m Berk Gulsen, a hardworking and versatile individual with a strong foundation in customer service, teamwork, and community engagement. Throughout my experiences, I’ve had the opportunity to develop skills that showcase my adaptability, commitment, and creative approach to problem-solving. Whether through my roles in retail and customer service or my volunteer work, each experience has helped me become a proactive, reliable, and innovative thinker.

One of my first jobs was as a cashier at Chipotle, which introduced me to the fast-paced world of customer service. In this role, I learned how to work efficiently, manage multiple tasks at once, and quickly resolve issues under pressure. It was important to me to provide the best experience for each customer, making sure orders were correct and interactions were positive. I took pride in bringing a sense of calm and care to a bustling environment, which helped me strengthen my communication skills and patience. My responsibility and reliability made me a trusted part of the team, and this experience built my confidence in handling any challenge that came my way.

Alongside my work experience, I also spent two years volunteering at the Orange County Discovery Cube. Volunteering here allowed me to give back to my community and engage with visitors in a way that encouraged learning and curiosity. I loved interacting with kids and families, explaining exhibits, and helping them enjoy the experience to its fullest. It was a rewarding experience that taught me to adapt my communication style to different age groups and make complex information accessible and engaging. This volunteer work helped me grow as a communicator and a team player, and it gave me a deep appreciation for the impact of community involvement.

I also worked at Target for six months, which gave me even more insight into customer service and team dynamics in a retail environment. I enjoyed working alongside my coworkers to manage stock, assist customers, and keep the store running smoothly. In this role, I was always looking for ways to make processes more efficient and support my team in any way I could. My colleagues knew they could count on me, and I valued the opportunity to solve problems and improve operations. This experience further solidified my commitment to being an out-of-the-box thinker and a supportive teammate.

Through all these experiences, I’ve gained skills that I believe make me a strong asset in any environment. My background has taught me the importance of hard work, creativity, and collaboration, and I’m constantly motivated to keep growing and learning. Whether in a work or volunteer setting, I strive to bring my best to every role, and I genuinely enjoy making a positive impact on those around me. As I move forward, I look forward to applying these skills in new and meaningful ways, always ready to take on new challenges and work with others to achieve great results.
